        <b>Hollywood</b>
        <p>Walt Disney Co.’s “Black Panther” smashed Presidents’ Day weekend records with a $235 million debut, a showing that may force Hollywood to reassess the work it gives black actors and filmmakers.

                The first Marvel superhero movie with an African-American in the title role kept drawing unprecedented crowds after setting an all-time high with $192 million estimated weekend sales, ComScore Inc. said Monday in an email. The four-day box-office showing also exceeded Disney’s forecast.</p>

    <p id="2">After being sent in, Sri Lanka amassed their highest total against Bangladesh and fifth highest overall. Mendis and Danushka Gunathilaka had set the base with a 98-run opening stand before Upul Tharanga and Dasun Shanaka plundered 45 in 19 balls to provide the finishing kick.

            Mendis continued from where he had left off in Mirpur and went after the Bangladesh bowlers from the first over. He punished debutants Abu Jayed and Mahedi Hasan in the early exchanges before lofting left-arm spinner Nazmul Islam over his head for a six in the fourth over.
            
            Gunathilaka, who was dropped twice on 15 and 28, contributed 42 in a 98-run opening stand, before part-time seamer Soumya Sarkar had him holing out to long-off in his first over.
            
            Mendis, who had brought up a 29-ball fifty, then ceded the stage to Thisara Perera, who was promoted to No. 3. Thisara laid into Sarkar, hitting three boundaries in the 14th over, including a six over the sight screen. He added 51 off 27 balls with Mendis before he was caught at long-off too.
            
            An over later, Mendis top-edged a pull to deep midwicket, but Tharanga and Shanaka sustained the momentum. Tharanga slammed Jayed for two fours and a six, back-to-back, in the 18th over before Shanaka took four boundaries off Mustafizur Rahman in the next over. Tharanga fell for 25 in the last over of the innings but Shanaka's unbeaten 30 off 11 balls helped Sri Lanka finish strongly.
            
            Sri Lanka then built on their surge by picking up three wickets in the first three overs of the chase. Akila Dananjaya had Sarkar top-edging a catch to Jeevan Mendis at point while Madushanka removed both Mushfiqur Rahim and Mohammad Mithun in the same over.
            
            When Tamim Iqbal became debutant Amila Aponso's maiden international wicket, Bangladesh were 59 for 4. Jeevan Mendis then trapped Ariful Haque for 2 in the next over to extend Bangladesh's misery.
            
            Mahmudullah fought with 41 off 31 balls and added 42 for the sixth wicket with Mohammad Saifuddin. The end, however, was swift for Bangladesh: they lost their last five wickets 25 runs to be bowled out in 18.4 overs. Gunathilaka had applied the finishing touches by dismissing Mustafizur and Jayed in four balls.</p>

    <p id="1">During the 2016 presidential campaign, Romney excoriated Trump as a “fraud” who was “playing the American public for suckers.” Trump responded that Romney had “choked like a dog” in his 2012 campaign against President Barack Obama.</p>

    <p id="3">Success breeds success in Hollywood, and the money “Black Panther” rakes in will almost certainly open the door to more action films with black casts and filmmakers. While Disney hasn’t announced a sequel, one seems likely.
    
            “We really look forward to the day when these aren’t anomalies,” John Fithian, chief executive officer of the National Association of Theatre Owners, told Bloomberg TV on Friday. “These movies can set precedents for other movies like this in the future.”
            
            For the extended weekend, “Black Panther” topped Disney’s $210 million sales projection, a forecast the company raised on Saturday from $198 million. Box Office Pro had estimated sales of $205 million, while Box Office Mojo predicted $212 million.
            
            Disney will follow next month with “A Wrinkle in Time,” a young-adult film with a large, diverse cast from African-American director Ava DuVernay, the first woman of color to direct a movie with a budget of $100 million.</p>
